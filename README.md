# Sparse_Matrix
Sparse matrix is a matrix which contains very few non-zero elements. So there is an other way to represent it.
A sparse matrix can be represented by using TWO representations, those are as follows...

1).Triplet Representation
2).Linked Representation

### main.cpp represents a matrix by using TRIPLET REPRESENTATION of Sparse Matrix
